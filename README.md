# Binary Acoustic Mask (BAM)

Hey!

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the Binary Acoustic Mask (BAM), a speech processing solution that combines speech enhancement and acoustic masking. This solution was presented in the [Signal Processing Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9446642/) and the study that originated this solution was summarized in the [Ph.D thesis](https://lasp.ime.eb.br/docs/thesis/tese_felipe_2021.pdf) published in 2021.
